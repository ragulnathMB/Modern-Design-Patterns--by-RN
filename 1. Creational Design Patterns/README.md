# Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Included Patterns
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

Each pattern folder contains:
- A `README.md` explaining the intent, when to use, and how to run.
- Eight language folders: `C#`, `Go`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Kotlin`, `Rust`, `Typescript`, `c++`.
- In every language folder:
  - `Example` file: a small, runnable demo with no external libraries.
  - `Template` file: a minimal skeleton you can adapt to your domain.

## How to Navigate
Open any pattern directory and choose your preferred language. The example files are self-contained and include compile/run comments at the top.

## Notes
- For TypeScript examples, compile only the example file to avoid duplicate identifier errors with templates.
- All examples avoid external dependencies; standard compilers/interpreters are enough.
