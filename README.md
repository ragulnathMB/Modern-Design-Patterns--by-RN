# Modern Design Patterns – Comprehensive Implementation Guide

A comprehensive, code-driven repository implementing all **22 Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns** with examples and templates across **9 programming languages**.

## What Are Design Patterns?

**Design Patterns** are proven, reusable solutions to common problems in object-oriented software design. Rather than solving a problem from scratch, a design pattern offers a template that can be customized and adapted to your specific needs.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- Promote **clean architecture** and **reusability**
- Improve **code readability** and **communication** among developers
- Help in **scaling applications** while reducing technical debt
- Essential for **technical interviews** and **system design**

## When NOT to Use Design Patterns

- For simple problems that don't need abstraction
- When they overcomplicate the design
- Blindly applying patterns can result in **overengineering**
- Patterns should solve real problems, not demonstrate knowledge

## When to Use Design Patterns

- When your project starts growing and needs to scale
- When you see **repeated code or structure**
- When different modules need to **communicate with loose coupling**
- During **interview preparation** or **learning system architecture**

## Repository Contents

This repository contains comprehensive implementations of all 22 GoF patterns organized into three categories:

### Creational Patterns (5 patterns)
Focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Singleton** | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access |
| **Factory Method** | Creates objects without specifying exact classes |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creates families of related objects |
| **Builder** | Constructs complex objects step by step |
| **Prototype** | Creates objects by cloning existing instances |

### Structural Patterns (7 patterns)
Deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between entities.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adapter** | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together |
| **Bridge** | Separates abstraction from implementation |
| **Composite** | Composes objects into tree structures |
| **Decorator** | Adds behavior to objects dynamically |
| **Facade** | Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem |
| **Flyweight** | Minimizes memory usage by sharing data |
| **Proxy** | Provides placeholder/surrogate for another object |

### Behavioral Patterns (10 patterns)
Focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes requests along chain of handlers |
| **Command** | Encapsulates requests as objects |
| **Iterator** | Provides sequential access to collection elements |
| **Mediator** | Defines how objects interact with each other |
| **Memento** | Captures and restores object state |
| **Observer** | Notifies multiple objects about state changes |
| **State** | Changes object behavior based on internal state |
| **Strategy** | Defines family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable |
| **Template Method** | Defines algorithm skeleton, subclasses fill in details |
| **Visitor** | Defines operations on object structure elements |

## Languages Supported

Each pattern is implemented in **9 programming languages**:

- **C#** - Modern object-oriented language with strong typing
- **C++** - Systems programming with object-oriented features
- **Go** - Simple, efficient language with interfaces
- **Java** - Platform-independent object-oriented language
- **JavaScript** - Dynamic language for web and server development
- **Kotlin** - Modern JVM language with concise syntax
- **Python** - Readable, versatile language with strong OOP support
- **Rust** - Systems language with memory safety
- **TypeScript** - Typed superset of JavaScript

## Repository Structure

Each pattern folder contains:
- **README.md** - Pattern explanation, when to use, key points
- **Language folders** - One for each of the 9 supported languages
- **Example files** - Practical, runnable demonstrations
- **Template files** - Minimal scaffolding for quick implementation
