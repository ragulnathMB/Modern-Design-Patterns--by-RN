# 🧠 Mastering Design Patterns – Visual Guide by RN

Welcome to **Mastering Design Patterns** – a clean, code-driven, visual repository for understanding the **22 classic Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns** with implementations in multiple languages.

---

## 📘 What Are Design Patterns?

**Design Patterns** are proven, reusable solutions to common problems in object-oriented software design.  
Rather than solving a problem from scratch, a design pattern offers a template that can be customized and adapted to your specific needs.

---

## 🤔 Why Use Design Patterns?

✅ Promote **clean architecture** and **reusability**  
✅ Improve **code readability** and **communication** among developers  
✅ Help in **scaling applications** while reducing technical debt  
✅ Useful in **interviews** and **real-world architecture design**

---

## 🚫 When *Not* to Use Design Patterns

❌ For *simple problems* that don’t need abstraction  
❌ When they *overcomplicate* the design  
❌ Blindly applying patterns can result in **overengineering**  
❌ Patterns should solve real problems, not just show off knowledge

---

## 🕒 When to Use Design Patterns?

- When your project starts growing and needs to scale  
- When you see **repeated code or structure**  
- When different modules need to **communicate clearly and loosely coupled**  
- During **interview prep** or **learning clean architecture**
