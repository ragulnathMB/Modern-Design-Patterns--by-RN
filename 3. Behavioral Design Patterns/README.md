# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on how objects communicate and distribute responsibilities.

## Included Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Repository Structure
- Each pattern folder contains a `README.md` describing the intent and when to use it.
- Eight language folders per pattern: `C#`, `Go`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Kotlin`, `Rust`, `Typescript`, `c++`.
- Each language folder provides two files:
  - Example: runnable demo (no external libraries).
  - Template: minimal skeleton to adapt for your domain.

## Notes
- TypeScript: compile examples separately from templates to avoid duplicate symbol warnings.
- Examples are intentionally small and focused on demonstrating the pattern.
