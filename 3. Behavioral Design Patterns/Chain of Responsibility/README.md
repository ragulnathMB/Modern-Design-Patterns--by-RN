# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## When to Use
- You want to decouple request senders from receivers.
- Multiple objects can handle a request, but you don't know which one in advance.
- You want to specify handlers dynamically and change the chain at runtime.

## Example Overview
Example: a support ticket system with different levels of handlers.
- Handler: `SupportHandler` interface with `handleRequest(ticket)` and `setNext(handler)`.
- Concrete Handlers: `Level1Support`, `Level2Support`, `Level3Support` handle tickets based on priority.
- Chain: Each handler tries to process the request; if it can't, it forwards to the next handler.

## Key Points
- Each handler contains a reference to the next handler in the chain.
- Handlers can choose to process the request, pass it along, or both.
- The chain can be built dynamically and modified at runtime.
