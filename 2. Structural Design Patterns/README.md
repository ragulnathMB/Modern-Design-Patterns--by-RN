# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Included Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Repository Structure
- Each pattern folder contains a `README.md` describing the intent and when to use it.
- Eight language folders per pattern: `C#`, `Go`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Kotlin`, `Rust`, `Typescript`, `c++`.
- Each language folder provides two files:
  - Example: runnable demo (no external libraries).
  - Template: minimal skeleton to adapt for your domain.

## Notes
- TypeScript: compile examples separately from templates to avoid duplicate symbol warnings.
- Examples are intentionally small and focused on demonstrating the pattern.
