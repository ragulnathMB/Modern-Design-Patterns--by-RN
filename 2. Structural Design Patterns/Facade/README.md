 # Facade Pattern

 The Facade pattern provides a unified, high-level interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.

 ## When to Use
 - **Simplify complex subsystems** by exposing a single entry point for common tasks.
 - **Decouple clients** from subsystem classes to reduce coupling and dependencies.
 - **Define layers**: use a facade to structure your code into layers with clear boundaries.

 ## Example Overview
 This example models a simplified computer boot process.
 - Subsystems: `CPU`, `Memory`, `HardDrive` expose low-level operations (`freeze`, `jump`, `load`, `read`, `execute`).
 - Facade: `Computer` coordinates the boot sequence via `start()` and a `shutdown()`.

 Clients interact only with the `Computer` facade, which hides the complexity and ordering requirements of the underlying subsystem operations.

 ## Key Points
 - A facade doesn't restrict access to subsystem classes; it just provides a simpler default interface.
 - Facades can be composed: multiple facades for different workflows over the same subsystem.
 - Reduces coupling and improves readability; subsystem details can evolve behind the facade.
